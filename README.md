An epic CHIP-8 emulator.

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that a piece of software can execute by emulating computer hardware for CHIP-8 programs to use. That piece of software, once fully functional, can run loads of cool games and apps.

This is a project that I really enjoy working on. I witnessed firsthand the importance of writing simple, sensible, documented, and overall beautiful code, and it was exciting to see it all come together elegantly. I also uncovered a lot of the magic behind how computers run, and itâ€™s quite crazy!

## How to Run
1. Install the .NET SDK if not already installed
2. Clone the repo
3. Run the "dotnet run" command with the path to a CHIP-8 program (see demo)

## Compatibility
- Only the IBM Logo program at this point (https://github.com/loktar00/chip8/blob/master/roms/IBM%20Logo.ch8)

## Achievements
- Run the IBM Logo program

## To-Do
- Implement a GUI
- Implement the rest of the instructions
- Add unit testing
