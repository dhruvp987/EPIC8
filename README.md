# EPIC8, an epic CHIP-8 emulator 😎
Run CHIP-8 software on your computer!

CHIP-8 is a virtual computer system, meaning it has a hardware specification but officially doesn't have physical hardware. Software can target and consist of instructions that run on this "hardware". An emulator is needed to run CHIP-8 software on normal computers. 

EPIC8 is not the first CHIP-8 emulator, but it will be one of the most exciting! 🌟
